# nisaba
A small Python CLI for searching and editing files.

nisaba is a lightweight but powerful CLI tool for searching and editing files. You can either search a single file or entire folders for specific search terms. 
Currently nisaba supports searching files looking for standard strings of text through the "file" and "folder" functions, as well as a specialized search for files
containing JSON formatted data using the "jfile" and "jfolder" functions. Future version will add similar functionality for xml files. For full explanations of each
function, use the --help tag while running the application from the console.
